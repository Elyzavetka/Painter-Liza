      Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of
      drying oil as the binder. It has been the most common technique for
      artistic painting on wood panel or canvas for several centuries, spreading
      from Europe to the rest of the world. The advantages of oil for painting
      images include "greater flexibility, richer and denser colour, the use of
      layers, and a wider range from light to dark".[1] But the process is
      slower, especially when one layer of paint needs to be allowed to dry
      before another is applied. The oldest known oil paintings were created by
      Buddhist artists in Afghanistan and date back to the 7th century AD.[2]
      The technique of binding pigments in oil was later brought to Europe in
      the 15th century, about 900 years later. The adoption of oil paint by
      Europeans began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and
      by the height of the Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost
      completely replaced the use of tempera paints in the majority of Europe.
      Oil paint was used by Europeans for painting statues and woodwork from at
      least the 12th century, but its common use for painted images began with
      Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the
      Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the
      use of egg tempera paints for panel paintings in most of Europe, though
      not for Orthodox icons or wall paintings, where tempera and fresco,
      respectively, remained the usual choice.
